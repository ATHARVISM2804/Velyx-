## 🏆 COMBO 1: "INTELLIGENT MEMORY LIFECYCLE"

**Theme:** Memory that learns, ages, and self-curates like human memory

| Component | Source | Points | Effort |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Decay & Reinforcement | memoripy | 3 pts | LOW |
| Frequency & Utility Tracking | ReMe | 3 pts | LOW |
| Auto-Pruning Low-Value Memories | ReMe | 3 pts | LOW |

**Total: 9 pts | LOW-MEDIUM effort**

### Why it's MAD:

```
Memory accessed often → gets STRONGER (reinforcement)
Memory ignored → gets WEAKER (decay)
Memory with low utility/freq ratio → gets DELETED automatically

Result: Self-healing, self-optimizing memory that mimics human forgetting!
```

### The Pitch:
> "Velyx now has HUMAN-LIKE memory - it remembers what matters and forgets what doesn't!"

### Technical Implementation:

```python
# Decay formula (from memoripy)
decay_factor = np.exp(-decay_rate * time_diff)
reinforcement_factor = np.log1p(access_count)
adjusted_similarity = similarity * decay_factor * reinforcement_factor

# Pruning logic (from ReMe)
if freq >= freq_threshold:
    if utility / freq < utility_threshold:
        delete_memory(memory_id)
```

## 🏆 COMBO 2: "SMART MEMORY GATE"

**Theme:** Don't save garbage, only save gold

| Component | Source | Points | Effort |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Salience Filtering | memlayer | 3-5 pts | MEDIUM |
| Decay & Reinforcement | memoripy | 3 pts | LOW |
| Background Curation Service | memlayer | 3 pts | MEDIUM |

**Total: 9-11 pts | MEDIUM effort**

### Why it's MAD:

```
INPUT: "Hello!" → BLOCKED (not salient)
INPUT: "My name is John, I work at Google" → SAVED (salient)
BACKGROUND: Old unused memories → AUTO-ARCHIVED
RETRIEVAL: Frequently accessed → BOOSTED

Result: Clean, high-quality memory that doesn't bloat!
```

### The Pitch:
> "Velyx now has a BOUNCER - only important memories get in, garbage stays out!"

### Technical Implementation:

```python
# Salience Gate (from memlayer)
class SalienceGate:
    SALIENT_PROTOTYPES = ["My name is...", "I work at...", "The deadline is..."]
    NON_SALIENT_PROTOTYPES = ["Hello", "Thanks", "Okay", "Got it"]

    def is_worth_saving(self, text: str) -> bool:
        # Compare similarity to salient vs non-salient prototypes
        salient_score = max_similarity(text, SALIENT_PROTOTYPES)
        non_salient_score = max_similarity(text, NON_SALIENT_PROTOTYPES)
        return salient_score > (non_salient_score + threshold)
```

## 🏆 COMBO 3: "KNOWLEDGE BRAIN"

**Theme:** Memory that understands relationships

|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge Graph | memlayer | 5 pts | HIGH |
| Entity Extraction | memlayer | 3 pts | MEDIUM |
| Graph Traversal Retrieval | memlayer | 3 pts | MEDIUM |

**Total: 11 pts | HIGH effort**

### Why it's MAD:

```
INPUT: "John works at Google. Sarah is John's wife."

GRAPH:
    John --[works_at]--> Google
    John --[married_to]--> Sarah

QUERY: "Who is related to Google?"
RESULT: John (works there), Sarah (married to John who works there)

Result: Memory that REASONS about relationships!
```

### The Pitch:
> "Velyx now has a BRAIN - it understands how things connect!"

### Technical Implementation:

```python
# Knowledge Graph (from memlayer)
import networkx as nx

class KnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.Graph()

    def add_entity(self, name: str, node_type: str):
        self.graph.add_node(name, type=node_type)

    def add_relationship(self, subject: str, predicate: str, obj: str):
        self.graph.add_edge(subject, obj, relation=predicate)

    def get_subgraph_context(self, entity: str, depth: int = 2):
        # Traverse graph for related entities
